# Spin-orbit coupling
*vibronics* is based on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, who may need relativistic correction

Since the vibronic levels are nonrelativistic, we can and only can add perturvative spin-orbit coupling correction. If the relativistic effect is significant, we need to derive new *diabatz* and *vibronics* from rigurous 4c (or maybe x2c) electronic wave functions

Currently this program only supports 2 nonrelativistic doublets

Currently this program assumes Franck-Condon approximation for Breit-Pauli spin-orbit coupling
