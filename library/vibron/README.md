# A library to define and process vibronic wave function
This library does 3 jobs:
1. define vibrational basis functions, who are direct products of 1D harmonic oscillator wave functions
2. define vibronic basis functions, who are direct products of diabatic electronic states and vibrational basis functions
3. evaluate 1D harmonic oscillator integrals
