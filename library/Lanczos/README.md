# A library for Lanczos diagonalization
This library does 3 jobs:
1. define diabatic electronic Hamiltonian
2. perform matrix-vector multiplication between diabatic vibronic Hamiltonian and vibronic wave function
3. perform Lanczos iteration

This library depends on *vibron* to define vibronic wave function
